The whole theme is based on [mdui](http://mdui.org/) front end.

And it also has some advanced feature, such as built in local storage,

`Plus` and `Now` has a different design of index page. Plus's index page is based on the `Google Plus` design so Now's is based on `Google Now`.

Also they has some diffenece on the basic elements, I'm sure that you can figure them out.
